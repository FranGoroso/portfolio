# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my online portfolio. This project is designed to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer. On this site, you will find information about me, projects I've completed, and the technologies I use.

**Note**: Mobile design is under development. Currently, the page is not fully responsive, but I am working to improve the mobile experience.

## Features

- **Modern design**: This portfolio features a clean and modern layout that highlights my projects.
- **Featured projects**: It showcases a selection of my best works, from frontend development to the implementation of complex functionalities.
- **Interactive animations**: I use animations and visual effects to make the navigation more engaging.

## Technologies used

- **React**: For building the user interface in a modular and efficient way.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and pre-built components.
- **Vite**: Used as a bundling tool and for fast development.
- **AOS**: For animations triggered by scrolling on the page.
